# WimAsAService Module


Welcome to the WIM As A Service documentation. On this Page you will
find tutorials, scripts and FAQ to help you use our service.

### Introduction

WIM As A Service is an innovative online service developed by BaseVISION
AG. This service allows you to configure WIM (Windows Imaging Format)
files according to your personal requirements. The WIM files are then
generated in our infrastructure. After generating such an image, you can
download your own WIM file directly through your web browser. With this
service we try to support your BASE operation tasks and give your
employees more time for VISION tasks.

## WIM2USB

With WIM2USB, you don't need a deployment solution like MDT or Config
Manager. You can deploy your images just with a USB Stick and even
customize the deployment and add drivers.
